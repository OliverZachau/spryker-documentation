                                                <p>Each Capability is marked to define if it is a B2C <img src="../resources/images/shoptype/b2c_shop.png" /> or a B2B <img src="../resources/images/shoptype/b2b_shop.png" /> capability. </p>
                                                <p>Capabilities are high level descriptions of what a certain facet of Spryker can do. Each Capability is mapped to a list of Features. A Feature is a specific aspect of a Capability, for example, the Cart Capability includes the features, "Cart Functionality" and "Calculations, Cart Rules" and "Discounts and Multiple Carts Per User". All the features together help to define the exact scope of a Capability. This helps us to guide you to the relevant functionality you are looking for. Each Feature has its own distinct functionality, this is the actionable information about a feature and describes the different activities you can perform with a feature like, Add, Delete, Modify, Extend etc. The Functionality for each Feature is listed according to user type to help distinguish between content intended for Developers (PHP&#160;Developers and Front End Developers), and End Users who work with the Administration Interface (Category Managers, Sales, Marketing and Finance or any other people involved in creating and customizing your main interaction point with your customers). </p>
                                                <p>Look out for our special Icons that will help you identify content based on if it is for a Developer <img src="../resources/images/icon_persona_developer_64.png" /> or an Administration Interface User <img src="../resources/images/icon_persona_end-customer_64.png" /></p>
