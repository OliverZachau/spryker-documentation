    <body>ML MS MC All orders can be paid with none, one or multiple payment methods which the customer can select during checkout. To accommodate your customer's requirements, you can offer multiple payment methods for a single order, such as gift card and an additional credit card. Most orders are paid with a single payment method but in same cases it is useful to allow multiple payment methods, for instance the customer may want to use two credit cards or he uses gift card in addition to a traditional payment method.</body>
