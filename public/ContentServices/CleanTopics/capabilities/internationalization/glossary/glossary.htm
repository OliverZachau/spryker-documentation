    <body>The Glossary module has the responsibility to manage glossary keys that hold the localized content in the database. For each entry in the glossary keys table there is a corresponding entry in the Touch table that has a timestamp that marks the last update that was made on that glossary keys that needs to be updated also in the front end key-value storage. The glossary keys are kept in sync on the key-value storage by using a cronjob that periodically runs the update storage collector command. The storage collector grabs the glossary key entries that were marked for update in the touch table after the last storage update command was ran.
