    <body>MS The fully automated Stock calculation takes into consideration products that are reserved in open orders when defining availability. Also, you can define never-out-of-stock products, such as digital downloads.
In contrast to Stock, Availability considers not only the number of products in the warehouse, but currently open orders, too. Product Availability defines if a product can or cannot be sold in the shop.
