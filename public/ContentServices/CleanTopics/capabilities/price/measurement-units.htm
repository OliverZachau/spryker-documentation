    <body>ML&#160;MS&#160;MC Depending on your type of business you may not need to sell your products in quantities, but in length, weight or volume. The Spryker Commerce OS allows you to offer your products in a variety of different measuring units.
You can separate internal and external selling units to efficiently monitor your stock levels. A minimum and maximum order quantity can be defined to avoid over- or underselling. You can also freely define the intervals in which the products can be purchased.
All Measurement Units are applicable to multiple store set-ups and can be saved in different currencies. Products can be offererd with different measuring units, like item, weight (e.g. KG), length (e.g. Metres) or volume (e.g. CC). "- Separation of base unit (used for internal calculations like stock or price) and sales units (shown in frontend to allow the user buy according to his preferences) - For each product a minimum, maximum order qty as well as qty intervals can be defined. Minimum and maximum quantities limit the lower and upper limits of how many products a customer can buy, whereas the quantity interval sets the steps in which the product can be bought (e.g. 3,6,9)"</body>
