    <body>Manage your product catalog with customized categories, category pages and filters to easily handle and sort your items.
All products can be categorized into logical clusters, so that your customers can filter them in your shop. Easily define if categories should be searchable or hidden and thus will or will not appear in your shop or search.
You can add customizable category pages to your shop by using different CMS Block templates in order to build dedicated content such as marketing content in relevant landing pages or mimic a category drill-down experience. "- Product to category assignment via checkboxes - Multiple independent category trees - The same category can appear several times in one tree - Invisible categories - Categories can be searchable - Drag&amp;drop reordering of categories - Categories can have individual CMS templates (Category Pages) - Categories are shown in the shop with the number of products that match to the current filter selection - Empty categories are not displayed in the shop" If you are a: Front-End Developer</body>
