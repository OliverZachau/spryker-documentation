    <body>Upgrading from Version 3.* to Version 4.* Due to introducing the Suggestion Search feature, the Catalog bundle now requires Search &gt;=5.2. To upgrade from 3.* to 4.*: Before upgrading to the new version, make sure that you do not use any deprecated code from version 3.*. Check the description of the deprecated code to see what you will need to use instead. In the previous version\Spryker\Client\Catalog\CatalogDependencyProviderprovided by default a stack of query expander and a stack of result formatter plugins for the\Spryker\Client\Catalog\CatalogClient::catalogSearch()method. In the new version you need to provide the necessary plugins from project level instead in:\Pyz\Client\Catalog\CatalogDependencyProvider.
