Tax Set - Tax Rate Association A tax set has associated at least one tax rate. For products on which there aren’t applied any taxes : associate the abstract product to a tax set that has associated a tax rate with rate set to 0. Tax Set - Abstract Product Association An abstract product must have one tax set associated to it. The other way around, a tax set can be associated to 0 to n abstract products. Concrete products don’t have an associated tax set ( they apply only to abstract products) Example of tax sets : Tax set: “Low Tax Rate Germany” has 1 tax rate 7%. Tax set: “VAT Canada Quebec” has 2 tax rates 5% GST (Goods and Services Tax) and 9.7% QST (Québec Sales Tax).</body>
