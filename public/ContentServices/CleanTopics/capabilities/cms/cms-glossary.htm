    <body>Concept Definition Page Pages defined in CMS refer to web pages that are meant to be displayed in the front-end application (Yves). A page is defined by an URL and a template. Page URL When accessing the URL assigned to a page defined in CMS, the associated template will be loaded. Template The CMS uses Twig templates that are placed under src/Pyz/Yves/Cms/Theme/default/template/ folder. Placeholder Placeholders enable putting context to a template; a placeholder has a glossary key assigned, so at runtime, the placeholders are replaced by the corresponding glossary key value, considering the context. Block Partial page that can be embedded in other web pages. URL Redirect Technique for delivering a page under more then one URL address. When a request is made to an URL that was redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. URL Redirect Status When an URL is being redirected, the response contains a status code that describes the reason the redirect happened. The URL redirect status code plays an important role in search engine ranking. See also: Preview Draft Page Defining Maximum Size of Content Fields Last review date: Sep. 20th, 2017</body>
