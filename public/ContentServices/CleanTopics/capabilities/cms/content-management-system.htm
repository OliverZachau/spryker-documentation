    <body>The CMS (content management system) is a WYSIWYG-based tool for publishing, editing and changing the content displayed in the shop interface. The CMS includes full page, partial page and content creation. Pre-defined templates help you to quickly deliver and support branded pages with a consistent look and feel. Combining dynamic placeholders with CMS content allows you to automatically retrieve and display catalog items to build highly effective and adaptable promotional pages. The CMS gives you full control over the content in terms of searchability, drafting, versioning, ordering (by ID), activation and deactivation. CMS pages support multiple language localization including name and HTML meta header information. You can specify valid to and from dates (optional) to make CMS pages available (published) within a defined period. This feature is ideal for limited promotions.
