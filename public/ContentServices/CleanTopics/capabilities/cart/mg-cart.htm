    <body>Upgrading from Version 4.* to Version 5.* With the implementation of the quote storage strategies, the new version of the Cart module allows to use different behaviors for different strategies. SinceQuoteClient::getStorageStrategymethod is used now, the Quote module's version must be 2.0.0 or higher. CartClientInterface::storeQuotemethod is deprecated, remove it from your code and useQuoteClientInterface::setQuote()instead. CartClientInterface::getZedStubmethod is deprecated, remove it from your code and use\Spryker\Client\ZedRequest\ZedRequestClient::addFlashMessagesFromLastZedRequestto push stack of ZED request messages to flash messages. All logic fromCartClienthas been moved to\Spryker\Client\Cart\Plugin\SessionQuoteStorageStrategyPlugin. Make sure that all your local overwrites of those methods have been moved there.
