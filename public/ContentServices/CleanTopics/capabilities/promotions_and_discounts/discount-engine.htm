    <body>ML MS MC Discounts are a tool to support sales and marketing activities. With the intuitive discount query builder you can easily define which items the discount should apply to, such as single products, product groups, specific attributes or other relevant indicators. Choose the type of discount you want to offer, percentual or fixed monetary values, net or gross price, free complementary products or other options. Lastly, outline exactly when the discounts should be applicable, e.g. only to specific customer groups, when a certain cart value is reached, how long the discount should be valid or any business logic you need. Discounts are either automatically applied during the Checkout process or your customers have to enter a Voucher Code. Discounts are applied during checkout either manually by the customer via Voucher code or automated as Cart rule. In both cases the discount can have a fixed or a percentage value which is applied on all items or a sub-set which can be defined with a query string (e.g. only products with a specific attribute). It is also possible to implement customized calculator types to realize customized calculations. "- Fix price and percentage values. - Fix price values can be defined as gross or net values - Custom calculators can be added as plugin - Discount value that represents a gross or a net price per currency - Customers can use multiple discounts but discounts can also marked as ""exclusive"" to disallow checkouts with discount combinations - Validity dates - Complex query strings to define on which cart items the discount is applied - Discounts are distributed to all items of the quote (e.g. products, options, expenses, ...) so that they can be obeyed in the calculation of refunds - Add promotional products based on custom conditions to the cart"</body>
