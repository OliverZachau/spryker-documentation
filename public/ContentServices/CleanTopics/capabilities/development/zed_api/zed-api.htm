    <body>The Spryker OS offers a flexible REST API for Zed. It maps basic REST functionality to the persistence layer of the Spryker backend. By default, the API accepts and returns JSON as format. But it can be extended to work with any format. As for JSON, the API specification is close to JSON API standard 1.0, with a few small differences, mainly where the Spryker API is a bit more allowing. BETA version This(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)is still in development. For questions and inquiries please contact academy@spryker.com</body>
