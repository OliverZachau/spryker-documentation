    <body>Sometimes it should be ensured for a project that the just generated number is not used for the same purpose twice. Spryker provides Sequence Number module which handles the unique number generation. General Usage The sequence number facade contains ::generate() method which provides a unique number. Basic configuration should be provided to the generation method and could look like this: $sequenceNumberSettingsTransfer = new SequenceNumberSettingsTransfer(); $sequenceNumberSettingsTransfer-&gt;setName('Sequence1'); $sequenceNumberSettingsTransfer-&gt;setPrefix('SequencePrefix'); Limit List Sometimes it might be necessary to limit a sequence (sharding, debugging etc). To do so, just open your configuration php file
and add the following options: use Spryker\Shared\SequenceNumber\SequenceNumberConstants;
...
$config[SequenceNumberConstants::LIMIT_LIST] = [ 'Sequence1' =&gt; 10000
];
