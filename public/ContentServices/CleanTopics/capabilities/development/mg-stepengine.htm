    <body>Upgrading from Version 2.* to Version 3.* If you're migrating the StepEngine module from version 2 to version 3, you need to follow the steps described below. In Version 3 theStepCollectionInterface::getPreviousStep()has a new second optional argument (AbstractTransfer $dataTransfer). If you use this interface for your own implementation, you need to update your derived class. IfStepEngineInterface::getTemplateVariables()is overridden in your project, you need to update the call toStepCollectionInterface::getPreviousStep()here as well.
