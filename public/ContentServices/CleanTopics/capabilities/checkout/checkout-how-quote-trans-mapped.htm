    <body>Symfony forms provide a mechanism to store data into objects without having the need of a manual mapping. It’s called Data transformers . There are a few important things to make this work. Because we are passing the entireQuoteTransfer, the form handler does not know which fields are you trying to use. Symfony provides few ways to handle this situation: using property_path configuration directive It uses the full path to object property you are about to map form into, for examplepayment.paypalwill map your form toQuoteTransfer:payment:paypal; this works when the property is not on the same level and when you are using subforms. Another approach is using a main form that includes subforms. Each subform has to be configured withdata_classoption that is the FQCN of transfer object you are about to use. This works when property is in the top level.</body>
