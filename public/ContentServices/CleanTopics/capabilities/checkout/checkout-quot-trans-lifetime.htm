    <body>When a process is being called onStepProcess,it will try to get the current valid step by walking through the step stack and calling thepostCondition()for each, starting from the first in the stack. IfpostCondition()is being called onStepProcess, it will try to get the current valid step by walking through the step stack and calling thepostCondition()for each, starting from the first in the stack. IfpostCondition()failed, then this step will be used for later processing. After that, the view variables withQuoteTransferand form are passed to Twig and the HTML is rendered. Post Condition Post condition is an important part of the step Processing. Basically, this post condition indicates if a step has all the data that it needs and if its requirements are satisfied. It’s not possible to access next step from stack if previous step post conditions are not met, but it’s possible to navigate to any step where post conditions are satisfied (return true). Post conditions are called twice per step processing: To find the current step or if we can access the current step. Afterexecute(), to make sure the step was completed and that we can continue to next step. Post Condition Error Route Inside your step you can set a post condition error route. If you need to redirect to another error route than the one specified during the step constructi</body>
