    <body>The Product Groups feature allows to group together multiple abstract products for various reasons. One of the most common use cases of this feature is to group same products with different colors together to make user’s browsing more convenient. Once products are grouped together, on catalog and product detail pages instead of displaying individual item you can display the group. This means which each product you can also display references to other products which are in the same group as your produce. Read More: Feature Integration - Product Group Under The Hood</body>
