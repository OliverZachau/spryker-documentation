    <body>Category filters is a feature that provides full control over filters displayed in the catalog page. It allows reordering and removing of specific search filters from Yves based on some configuration per product category. This feature is especially useful in cases when a category has a lot of matching products that have plenty of filters associated with them. Control over the orders as well as the possibility to show/hide any of the lower priority ones, would allow less cluttering of the frontend for the user by showing them filters that would make sense to use with that category, rather than displaying all of the filters that have matching products. This feature is supported by 3 modules: ProductCategoryFilter module: Manages the core functionalities of the feature like CRUD of filters per product category, facet updating based on saved filters. ProductCategoryFilterCollector module: Provides full Collector logic to export product category filters to storage. ProductCategoryFilterGui module: Provides a Zed UI for manipulating filters per product category See also: Category Feature Integration - Category Filters Under the Hood - Category Filters Last
