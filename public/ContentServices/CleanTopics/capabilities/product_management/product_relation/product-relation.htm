    <body>E-Commerce shops maximize value for their shop visitors by helping them explore products that are related to the one they are currently interested in. These relations appear in different ways such as displaying similar products, upgrades of products (Product-relations), or simply products that fit into a certain context (Up-Selling). In our case these relations are defined manually by the shop owner in Zed.
