    <body>Query build in Zed allows to select and bulid a dynamic related product query. The query ships with pre-set rules: sku - filter by abstract product sku. name - filter by abstract product name. The locale is Zed’s default locale. If a product matches in that locale it will be related in both locales. created_at - string value date when the abstract product was created. category - is the name of category in the current zed locale. attributes - is the list of attributes as defined in spy_product_attribute_key database table. These rules can be combined withandororoperators, and it is also possible to nest them to make complex rules. When a product relation form in a saved configured rule is executed, all matching abstract product ids are saved inspy_product_relation_product_abstract relation table. Also, the collector is touched and relations are exported to Yves data store. Collector exports, list of abstract products with image, url, name, price… When a query is selected and a relation in saved, the relation needs to be manually updated to reflect latest changes (run again given query). The console commandproduct-relation:updateit will run all active relations with theis_rebuild_scheduledflag in the database tablespy_product_relationselected. This command can also be executed by spryker cron jobs and manually triggered via Jenkins.</body>
