    <body>Product TTL (Time to Live) allows you to can define the when your products are available online and when they are not. To get the main idea of the TTL, go to the general feature overview for more detailed information of how it works as well as familiarize yourself with its usage scenarios. TTL For Products Feature Details The TTL feature is implemented throughisActivefield by introducing two more fields for product concretes in the Administration Interface - "Valid from" and "Valid to". Product can have exactly one "life" - one (or no) start, one (or no) end. If "Valid from" date has not come yet, or if "Valid to" has been reached, the value ofisActivefield is set to "false" and the product is invisible for customers. This being said, the product validity settings overrule manual (de)activation of products, which means that, if, for example, a product has been manually set to "Deactivated" but has "Valid from" and Valid to" values specified, and "Valid to" lies in the future, the product will be displayed until after the time set in "Valid to" field. To deactivate the product in this case, it would be necessary to clear the values in "Valid from" and "Valid to" fields. Time set for the product validity "Valid from" and Valid to" fields is accurate up to the minute, however technically it is possible to change the accuracy (up to the second or up to the days) via a cronjob. The time is set in GMT by default. Use Cases The table below shows possible usage scenarios with the TTL feature and resulting system behavior. Validity dates settings Result "Valid from" is set, "Valid to"&#160;is set and lies in the future Product goes online starting from "Valid to" time and remains online until after the "Valid to" time "Valid from" is set, "Valid to" is not set Product goes online from "Valid from" time and never goes offline "Valid from" is not set, "Valid to"&#160;is set Product goes online after manual activation and remains online till "Valid to" time is reached "Valid to" is set in the past Product will be deactivated shortly "Valid from" is set, "Valid to"&#160;is set and lies in the future, the product is deactivated manually Message saying that the product will be activated because of set "Valid from"&#160;and "Valid to" time See
