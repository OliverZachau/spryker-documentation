    <body>Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.* From version 2 we have support multi-currency. First of all make sure you have migrated the Price module . We have changed collector dependency to use PriceProduct module instead of price, please update your code accordingly if you overwrote the core. If you modified"ProductAbstractTableHelper"table class, then this class now receives different bridge"ProductSetGuiToPriceProductFacadeInterface"insted of"ProductSetGuiToPriceProductInterface".
