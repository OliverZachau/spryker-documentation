    <body>With the Spryker Commerce OS you can easily build a product hierarchy structure with Abstract and Concrete Products.
Products can come with multiple Variants, such as size or color. In order to provide a better shopping experience to your customers, the different Variants, or Concrete Products, are grouped under an Abstract Product. The topmost hierarchy level, the Abstract Product, does not have its own stock, but defines various default properties for the descendant Concrete Products, or Variants. The Concrete Product, or Variant, always belongs to one Abstract Product, has a distinctive stock and always differs from another Concrete Product with at least one Super Product Attribute. "With the Spryker Commerce OS you can easily build a product hierarchy structure. Products can come with multiple Variants, such as size or color. In order to provide a nice shopping experience to your customers, the different Variants, or Concrete Products, are grouped under an Abstract Product. The topmost hierarchy level, the Abstract Product, does not have its own stock, but defines various default properties for the descendant Concrete Products, or Product Variants. The Concrete Product, or Variant, always belongs to one Abstract Product, has a distinctive stock and always differs from another Concrete Product with at least one Super Product Attribute. Super Attributes in the Spryker Commerce OS are used to distinguish between the different Product Variants of an abstract product. Super Attributes define each Concrete Product and can consist of whichever distinguishing feature you wish to highlight, such as size or color. This information can either be manually managed or imported and processed automatically. Consider the example of a T-shirt, the Abstract Product, that is available in the sizes small, medium, and large, three different Product Variants. The Abstract Product ""T-shirt"" appears as a search result. On the product detail page the customer can select between the product variants small, medium, large and put it into the cart. You can clearly define timeframes for the availability of products, without having to manually manage the inventory. This is especially useful for promotions or seasonal items."
