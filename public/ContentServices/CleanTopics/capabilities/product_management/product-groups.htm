    <body>To enhance the visual shopping experience for your customers, you can easily group together different products by any attribute you wish, like color or size. The respective product group will then be displayed as a single item in the shop. In the backend, you can view all product group items from the product page. Product groups are used to link abstract products together which are equal from the customer point of view (e.g. different colors of a shoe). - Place product groups in cms placeholders</body>
