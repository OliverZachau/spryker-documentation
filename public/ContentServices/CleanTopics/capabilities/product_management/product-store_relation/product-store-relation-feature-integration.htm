    <body>General Information By default abstract products are available in all stores. This feature provides additional configuration when: you have multiple stores, and you want to manage the appearance of abstract products per store. Prerequisites To prepare your project to work with multi-store abstract products: Update/installspryker/collectorto at least6.0.0version. You can find additional help for feature migration here . Update/installspryker/touchto at least4.0.0version. You can find additional help for feature migration here . Update/installspryker/storeto at least1.3.0version. Update/installspryker/productto at least6.0.0version. You can find additional help for feature migration here . If you want to have Zed Admin UI support for the multi-store abstract product management: update/installspryker/productmanagementto at least0.10.0version. You can find additional help for feature migration here . OverrideSpryker\Zed\Store\StoreConfig::isMultiStorePerZedEnabled()in your project to returntrue. This will enable the store management inside the Product Information Management (PIM) Zed Admin UI. Example override &lt;?php
namespace Pyz\Zed\Store; use Spryker\Zed\Store\StoreConfig as SprykerStoreConfig; class StoreConfig extends SprykerStoreConfig
{ /** * @return bool */ public function isMultiStorePerZedEnabled() { return true; }
} You should now be able to use the Product Information Management (PIM) Zed Admin UI to manage abstract product store relation.
