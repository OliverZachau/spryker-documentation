    <body>In a multi-store environment it might be necessary to configure the abstract product appearance per store (by default, all abstract products are available in all stores). A dedicated partial form in Zed Admin UI allows to manage abstract product-store relations. Customers can see only those abstract products (and their concrete products) which are associated with the displayed current store. Multi-store abstract product configuration feature is supported by 4 modules: Collector module: Offers multi-store capable data export for Search and Storage. Store module: Provides a generic store-relation handling partial form. ProductManagement module: Provides CRUD over store relation within the abstract product Zed Admin UI. Product module: Provides business logic to handle abstract product store relation management. Provides database structure definition to persist store relation.
