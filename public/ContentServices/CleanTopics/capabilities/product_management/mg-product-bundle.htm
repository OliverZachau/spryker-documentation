    <body>Upgrading from Version 3.* to Version 4.* In version 4 we have added support for multi-currency. First of all make sure you migrated the Price module . If you extendedProductBundleCartExpander, then you have to adapt some code because we changed how price is selected for added bundle products, check that core changes and adapt accordingly. We have also added a new plugin to handle cart reload event. You will also need to add\Spryker\Zed\ProductBundle\Communication\Plugin\Cart\CartBundleItemsPreReloadPluginplugin to\Pyz\Zed\Cart\CartDependencyProvider::getPreReloadPlugins(), this ensures that bundle items are correctly updated when currency is changed and cart reload is invoked. Upgrading from Version 2.* to Version 3.* In version 3 the calculator plugin has been changed together with the new calculator version. TheProductBundlePriceAggregatorPluginhas been moved to theSalesAggregatormodule, so you may need to change the namespace\Spryker\Zed\SalesAggregator\Communication\Plugin\OrderAmountAggregator\ProductBundlePriceAggregatorPluginif you still want to use it. aggregator. ProductBundlePriceCalculation- does not have sales aggregator logic anymore. This class has been adapted to the new calculator concept, if you want to use the old one, use it from\Spryker\Zed\SalesAggregator\Business\Model\OrderAmountAggregator\ProductBundlePrices.
