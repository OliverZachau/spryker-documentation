    <body>Product options allow to configure a product further. You can define option types and each option type can have 1 to n options values. Furthermore, multiple prices can be attached to an option value depending on current currency and price mode. Example You want to sell a piece of artwork as a product abstract and you want to allow to the customers to customize the frame they buy. You can define each frame type as a different option value for your product abstract. Each frame (product option value) can have different prices per currency and price mode (net/gross). Option value 1 - Default frame: costs gross 10€ (only available in gross EUR) Option value 2 - No frame: costs net 50€, gross 60€, net 20CHF, gross 30CHF Option value 3 - Stylish frame: costs net 150€, gross 160€ (not available in CHF) Option value 4 - Old style frame: costs net 100€, net 100CHF (not available in gross mode) The concept is pretty close to the variants concept, however if the number of possible combinations gets too big or if options have specific prices or if options exclude other options, the product option concept is better suited than the variant concept. A configuration of a product is called the set of option value selections for each option type. The set of all possible configurations is called the configuration space. For a concrete product one default configuration can be stored. This will be used on the product detail page for the initial configuration of the product. In general an option does not have a stock. You can assign a tax set to a product option. See Handling tax for details.
