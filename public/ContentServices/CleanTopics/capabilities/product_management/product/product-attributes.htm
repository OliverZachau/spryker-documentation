    <body>One way to describe a characteristic of a product is the attribute mechanism. It allows to store a list of key value pairs. There are 4 possible locations where attributes can be stored. Common attributes to all variant are stored on the level of the abstract product. However if they contain language or locale specific data, the abstract product attributes are the right location. If attributes like the size of the t-shirt distinguish variants, they are stored on product level. Again if the attributes are language or locale specific they are stored on product attributes. The attribute mechanism is only recommended if the information stored is for display purpose only. As soon as you want to program against it, we recommend extending one of the four tables. Attribute Key Metadata Redis can work with key value pairs as defined in the product attributes tables. However elastic search needs more information about the attributes semantic. Is the content of an attribute part of the fulltext search or is it used to sort the attribute. Therefore needed metadata is stored in the attribute meta data tables. These are used by the front end exporter to control which attributes of the product is stored where in the elastic search structure.</body>
