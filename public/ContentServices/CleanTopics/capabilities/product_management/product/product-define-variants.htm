    <body>Spryker’s data structure for products allows to design a product hierarchy. The abstract product does not have stock, but defines various default properties for the descendant concrete products (product variants). The concrete product (product variant) always belongs to 1 abstract product and has a distinctive stock. The concrete products (product variants) of an abstract product always differ from each other with at least 1 super product attribute. In a multi-store environment the abstract product can be configured to appear only in specific stores. See further information about multi-store products here . Consider the example of a T-Shirt (abstract product) that is available in the sizes small, medium, and large (each size is a different product variant). The T-shirt appears in a category page or as a result of search. On the product detail page (PDP) customers can select from product variants and put them into the cart.
