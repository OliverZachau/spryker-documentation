    <body>"Make it easier for your business customers to submit regular orders with the Shopping List feature. Business users can create multiple named shopping lists to prepare and manage their regular orders with ease. Users can add and save product quantities and options and check availability of each product directly in the list. Your customers can either add the entire list or parts thereof to the cart and also create a new shopping list from an order. Before proceeding to the checkout, adjustments to the cart can be made. Each list can be shared among users of the same business unit. " Company users use shopping lists to prepare and manage orders that they do regularly. For example a restaurant can prepare lists for their regular orders of meat, vegetables and drinks. These lists can be merged into one cart, adjusted and checked out by the chef on daily base. "- Add products with quantity and options - Multiple named list - Availability of products is shown in the list directly - Share with other users of the same company with read and write permission - Move all or some items to cart - Create shopping list from cart"</body>
