    <body>When adding a new step, you must implement theStepInterface. TheStepInterfacedefines all the methods thatStepEngineneeds when executing a step: preCondition()- here you define the requirements for the step to get executed requireInput()- here you define if the step requires user input (e.g. registration data) execute()- the logic that gets executed when running the step postCondition()- checks if the step can be considered finished, after execution getStepRoute()- the route that corresponds to the step (e.g.customer-step-routewill be transformed to/customer/registration) getEscapeRoute()- redirect URL for when thepreCondition()is not satisfied (this is usually the previous step URL) getTemplateVariables()- within this method you can pass additional template variables to the view When a step needs to redirect to an external URL, you can use theStepWithExternalRedirectInterface. TheStepCollectionInterface::getNextUrl()checks if an a external redirect URL is set and returns it. In some cases you may need to redirect the user afterStepInterface::execute()to another route than the defined one. For this purpose you need to useStepWithPostConditionErrorRouteInterface. The StepCollectionInterface::getNextUrl() checks if a post condition error route was set and returns the URL for it.</body>
