    <body>B2B commerce is all about commerce transactions between businesses or companies who market their goods or services to other companies. In the B2B partnership, which is usually based on contracts, the selling company is also referred to as merchant and the buyer is often represented by a business unit of a buying company. As a shop administrator, you can create, edit and delete merchants on the Merchants page. To connect merchants and buyers together, you need to establish merchant to buyer relations in the system. To do so, go to Merchant Relations page. Besides creating relations, you can also edit and delete them there.</body>
