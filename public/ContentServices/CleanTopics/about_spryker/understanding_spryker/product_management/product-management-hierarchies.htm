    <body>Abstract and Concrete Products (Variants) Spryker Commerce OS’s data structure for products allows to design a product hierarchy, which Yves relies on to display products in the correct way. Every product consists of an abstract product and one or more concrete products, also called variants. Your customers cannot buy an abstract product. The item that can be put into cart is always the concrete product. Example: Image source:&#160;https://www.gliffy.com/go/share/image/sh9rjp81rrkrco4s7fhe.png?utm_medium=live-embed&amp;utm_source=custom Imagine your product is a shoe. This shoe comes in three different sizes, namely 40, 41, and 42. Now technically you could have 3 different standalone products with three product detail pages. From a customer perspective this is unnecessary overhead, especially considering that a product catalog should not display three times a product that will most likely look identical. From a product management perspective, the same product would have to be created three times with the only difference being the size. Differentiate between abstract and concrete products InSpryker Commerce OS, both abstract and concrete products have an SKU, name, description, price, product attributes, and media assets. This information, besides the SKU, is inherited from the abstract to the concrete products when they are created. However, only the concrete product has stock and may have one or more additional attributes that we call super attributes (In the example above the super attribute is the size). This structure allows to create multiple variants of a product, which eventually are the products that your customers buy. Product Hierarchy in theSpryker Commerce OSDemoshop In the catalog of the shop frontend abstract products are listed (e.g. shoe model X blue). Once the customer has selected one of these abstract products and proceeded to the product detail page, the abstract products information is displayed first. Only after having selected the distinctive characteristic of a variant (e.g. size 41 for the shoe in the example above) the concrete product information is displayed (e.g. shoe model X color = blue size = 41). Note that the structure of the products is a business decisions and that both, abstract and concrete products, share the same URL in theSpryker Commerce OSdemoshop.</body>
