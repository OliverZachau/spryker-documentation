    <body>Product options can be used to create product additions that can be sold with the actual product. They don’t have stock, but a SKU that is linked to product abstracts. They cannot be bought without buying a corresponding product. Example product options are insurances or gift wrappings for products. Neither of them is sold normally without the actual main product. Product options are connected to abstract products. They appear in groups, since each group can have multiple product option values. Each product option value has a unique identifier and price configuration. On the group level, a tax set is attached to the product option values. Each option group can be linked to many different abstract products and vice versa.
