    <body>Product data is central data for shops. It contains characteristics that describe the product as well as characteristics that define their appearance in the shop. For example, the color of a product is an important information that the customer might need, whereas the weight of the product is needed to calculate delivery costs of a product. Likewise this information is very relevant for search behavior and eventually influences the conversion rate of customers in the shop. Typically, product data is maintained and enriched in an external Product Information Management (PIM) system. As soon as all characteristics are gathered, they can be imported toSpryker Commerce OS. The incoming product data must be transformed into the project specific data structure and is then persisted. After persisting the product data, the data is exported to Redis and Elasticsearch. Redis is used to store product data for performance reasons. Elasticsearch, on the other hand, is responsible for search. This way, Yves can access the relevant product data very fast. As your imported product data will most probably not have the ideal content, we offer you product management tools to enrich your product data before your product gets into the shop frontend.
