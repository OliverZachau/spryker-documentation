    <body>Updated: March 21st 2018 We at Spryker are happy to share our plans with you. Our plans are guidelines that give us direction, that move us forward to continuously evolve and improve our product. However, we are also flexible and we constantly listen and adapt. Therefore, our plans tend to change. So although we are good fulfilling our commitments, we reserve the right to change our priorities, remove or add new features from time to time. If you are planning anything strategic based on this list, you might want to talk to us first, either by contacting your Spryker representative or one of our Solution Partners. You are also welcome to contribute to the roadmap discussion in our Forum: Feature Roadmap Group . If you see a feature that you like, send us a mail and let us know why the feature is important to you. We have 2 categories in our roadmap: Upcoming Releaseswhich are in the short-term pipeline and have a somewhat high chance to be released in the upcoming months. Future Releasesare high-level raw backlog items that we plan to develop. You can easily contribute to these features by sharing with us how a given feature from this list is beneficial for your business, share your priorities or simply tell us what might be missing for you. Your input and needs are ideal to help shape upcoming feature releases. Please keep in mind, that certain things will not be built into core if we consider them to be too specific to a certain business case. However, the more you contribute the more you will help us know what you need to grow with us. The roadmap contains features not architectural items, enhancements, technology updates or any other strategic releases we are working on. We kindly ask you not to base any business decision on these lists without consulting with us first. Items are listed in no particular order. The order has no relevance to when they will be developed or released: Upcoming Releases CMS pages in search results Minimum order value per order per customer Alternative products for out of stock items</body>
