    <body>Previously we used Toran Proxy in our code hubcode.spryker.com. Since Toran Proxy has been deprecated and is being phased out, we have started to use public Packagist to host our modules. From now on, please download all Spryker modules from Packagist. The new tool is automatically already available without any change in yourcomposer.jsonthanks to Packagist being the default lookup for Composer. However, the deprecatedcode.spryker.comURLs should be removed from yourcomposer.lockto avoid the deployment process being slowed down by lookup misses once Toran becomes unavailable. First of all, remove thecode.spryker.comblock from your composer.json repositories section: "repositories": [ { "type": "composer", "url": "https://code.spryker.com/repo/private" }
], Then runcomposer update --lockto generate a fresh lock file with updated download URLs. The important part here is that--lockprevents any update of modules. So you are not accidentally upgrading any module here. That's it. Enjoy the new power of Packagist. To further speed up the composer update process, use this composer tool . After runningcomposer global require hirak/prestissimo, the nextcomposer updateorcomposer installcommand should be way faster for both local development and server deployment.
