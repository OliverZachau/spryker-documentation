    <body>Used to be: http://spryker.github.io/development-guide/zed/persistence-layer/query-object/ Query objects provide an object-oriented API for writing database queries which are used in query containers . Please check the official Propel Query Reference for a complete documentation. How to Create a New Query Object Query object are created by Propel during thebuild modelstep. See the schema definition for details how to describe them in XML. As you can seesrc/Orm/Zed/the query object which belongs to the Spryker core extend base classes placed in thevendordirectory. This way you can easily adopt the classes for your needs but we can still add methods in the core. Query class generator ThePropel (Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)alters the rules of generating query models by requiring explicit passing of filtering criteria intofilterBy..andfindBy...methods. This means, that when an array,LIKEexpression or an array withmin/maxare passed as a filtering argument, it is explicitly required to specifyCriteria::IN,Criteria::LIKEorCriteria::BETWEEN. TheCriteria::BETWEENis implemented in the wrapper classSpryker\Zed\Propel\Business\Runtime\ActiveQuery\Criteria. Additionally thePropel(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)adds the following methods into the generated classes, that allow to easily filter:filterBy...._In(),filterBy...._Like()andfilterBy...._Between().</body>
