This feature is extremely useful if you sell products with expiry date, seasonal products or products that are valid for a certain period of time (e.g. tickets), or if for promotional reasons, you temporally sell some products within a limited time frame, or if you want to start selling some products (e.g. a collection) from a specific date and/or time .

This has been fixed now - when saving a user role without changing it, nothing happens. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Acl 3.0.7 Error Message For Empty Mandatory Fields For CMS Page Previously we had the following issue: when trying to save a CMS page with empty mandatory fields for example, for DE translations (collapsed by default) in the Administration Interface, nothing happened - no error was shown. This issue has been fixed in this release - if mandatory fields, which are collapsed by default, are not filled, they are expanded and highlighted. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsGui 4.3.7 Mail Text Layout Fix Previously there was an issue with mail text layout - when sending an email in plain text, unnecessary spaces broke the layout. This has now been fixed - the spaces that caused the issue have been removed from the text layout. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Mail 4.0.2 PropelOrm Issue With DateTimes Earlier we had an issue when saving users in the Administration Interface without making any changes: unchanged entities were still marked as modified. This was caused by the fact that all entities used different time formatting for DateTimes. When toArray() of an entity was used, DateTime was formatted with -&gt;format('c') but the setter always used -&gt;format('Y-m-d H:i:s.u'). This lead to always changed entities. This issue is fixed now. Please make sure you are not using any project implementation that relies on the count of changed rows in such a scenario. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - PropelOrm 1.5.2 Filters And Category Tree On Yves Previously we had an issue with filters and category tree display on Yves: when category was accessed from the top navigation, the categories and filters section was not displayed. This issue has now been fixed.

Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Customer 7.5.1 Adding a New Filter To a Category Previously we had an issue when trying to add an existing attribute key to a category filter - the filter was not added. This is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductCategoryFilterGui 1.1.3 Clickable Name For a Deleted Customer Account There was an issue with customer name of a deleted account: it used to be clickable on order details page. This has now been fixed: if customer account has been deleted, the customer name is not clickable. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Sales 8.5.2 Discount For Promotional Products Previously we had the following issue: when adding a promotional products with several variants to cart and applying a discount, the discount was lost if variant of the promotional product was changed. This has been fixed: after changing variants of the promotional products, the discount is preserved.
