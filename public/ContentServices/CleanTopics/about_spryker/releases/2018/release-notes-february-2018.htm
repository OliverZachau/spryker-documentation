    <body>Please note, that we do not have Toran Proxy anymore, it has been shut down completely. Please use Packagist from now on. See more here . Features Product Search Widget Previously we had only product list widgets for which the products were selected based on their SKUs, whereas the selection was static and did not take product availabilities into account. In this release we are introducing a new Product Search widget which makes it possible for the shop administrator to define rules for the widget by building an Elasticsearch query where the administrator specifies what data should be included in the product search result. This makes the product selection with the Product Search widget dynamic and fully customizable. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - CmsContentWidgetProductSearchConnector 1.0.0 - Search 7.2.0 n/a Documentation For module documentation see: . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major and its dependencies: composer require spryker/cms-content-widget-product-search-connector:"^1.0.0" Multi-Store Product Abstract With this release we are introducing a new feature which allows to manage product abstracts across stores. Now the shop administrator can configure the abstract product appearance per store in the Administration Interface through a store toggle element available for each product abstract. The store toggle element controls the availability of the corresponding product abstract and related product concretes in specific store(s). Customers would be able to see only those abstract products (and their concrete products) which are associated with the store(s) defined by the shop administrator.

In this release the search mapping installer has been changed to import all mappings when index has not yet been created, which makes it possible to use features like parent / child relationship. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Collector 6.1.0 - Search 7.1.0 n/a Fixing Compatibility Issues In All FormTypes Previously some Spryker forms used deprecated code from Symfony. With this change, we have made sure all forms are not using code deprecated in Symfony Form 2.8. Mainly the string representation of types has been replaced with FQCN, for example$builder-&gt;add('foo', 'text')has been replaced with$builder-&gt;add('foo', TextType::class). We have also removed all constructors from the forms as the FormFactory no longer accepts instances of form types. All forms now extend Spryker's AbstractType to get access togetFactory(),getFacade(),getConfig()andgetQueryContainer(). If your forms have a constructor, please remove it and access what you need from inside the forms from now on.

With this release we have added Phone, Date of Birth, Company and Locale fields to "Create" and "Edit" pages in Customers section in the Administrator Interface, which allows to keep record of the necessary customer data.
