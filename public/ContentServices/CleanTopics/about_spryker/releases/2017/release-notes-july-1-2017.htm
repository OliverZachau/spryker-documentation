    <body>Features Selecting Product Variant in the Cart With this release we are bringing the variant selection functionality to the cart. Your shop user can now modify the selected variant right in the cart which will then, if available, replace the current item in the cart with the newly selected one (e.g. changing the size of a t-shirt or storage capacity of a smartphone). Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - CartVariant 1.0.0 - ProductImageCartConnector 1.0.0 n/a n/a Documentation For integration guides see: Cart Integration . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major and its dependencies: composer require spryker/cart-variant:"^1.0.0" spryker/product-image-cart-connector:"^1.0.0" Improvements and New Features for CMS Blocks With this release we are introducing CMS block as a completely decoupled module from CMS pages. Before the CMS blocks were stored with pages with the difference that block did not have page related properties (e.g. url, page meta information). With this decoupling we bring more flexibility to block and page maintenance, we also bring architecture flexibility which will allow you to create connections to other objects (e.g. Customer Group (show a block only for a specific group), Country (show a block for a products from a specific country), etc.). In addition to these we are introducing set of new features for CMS blocks: Valid from-to dates:Now you can easily define for how long a block should be in shop frontend. Own templating:Block template can now be different from page templates. In addition to this the template is not any more on locale level. Status:You can now globally activate or deactivate a given block. Before this was on locale level, with this update the activation/deactivation is on the block level. If the block is not active, than it’s not active for all locales Multi-locale content for placeholders:Each placeholder in the block has locale specific content (for as many locales as you have), management of which is now consolidated in one UI. Category and product blocks:From admin UI you can now also assign categories and product to a given block, which will imply that the block shows up for these categories and products in the shop frontend. Yet you can still also continue using blocks as static ones by simply placing them in your page’s template. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - Cms 6.0.0 - CmsBlock 1.0.0 - CmsBlockCategoryConnector 1.0.0 - CmsBlockCollector 1.0.0 - CmsBlockGui 1.0.0 - CmsBlockProductConnector 1.0.0 - CmsGui 4.0.0 - Product 5.2.0 - ProductManagement 0.7.0 - Twig 3.2.0 - CmsCollector 1.0.1 - CmsUserConnector 1.0.1 - Glossary 3.1.4 - NavigationGui 1.0.3 - ProductRelationCollector 1.1.1 Documentation For relevant documentation see: CMS Block Category Connector , CMS Block Product Connector , CMS Block .

It uses the same interface to access different types of file systems, regardless of their location or protocol. To do the heavy lifting it uses the FileSystem module which integratesthephpleague/flysystemvendor package. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - FileSystem 1.0.0 - Flysystem 1.0.0 - FlysystemAws3v3FileSystem 1.0.0 - FlysystemFtpFileSystem 1.0.0 - FlysystemLocalFileSystem 1.0.0 - Kernel 3.5.0 n/a Documentation For relevant documentation see: File System File Manager Module Guide , Flysystem Module Guide .

You can now import and manage from PIM multiple prices of a product. Those prices are also exported to Elasticsearch. For inspiration you can check our demoshop use case implementation for products on sale: if product has both original and default price, then the original price is strike through and the default price is the current sales price for the product. In Yves we have also introduced a filtered catalog for/outletwhere user can brows through all products that are currently on sale. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Price 4.2.0 - ProductRelationCollector 1.2.0 - ProductManagement 0.7.2 Discount Rules Based On Product Labels With this release we are now introducing a new connector module to handle discount rules based on product labels. This feature will allow you to define discount calculation and condition rules based on existing product labels. TODO Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - ProductLabelDiscountConnector 1.0.0 - Discount 4.2.0 - ProductLabel 1.1.0 - Discount 4.2.1 Documentation For relevant documentation see: Product Label Module Guide , Discount Module Guide . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/product-label-discount-connector:"^1.0.0" Multiple Payment Methods for One Sales Order Previously our schema allowed only one payment per sales-order. However there certain use case where it should be possible to calculate and save multiple payment methods for the given order (e.g. order with gift cards). With this release we enable multiple payment methods per checkout. We also make sure that payment information is persisted with store reference when order is placed. New payment hydration plugins will allow you extend the order transfer with payment related data. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - Payment 4.0.0 n/a - Braintree 0.5.3 - DummyPayment 2.0.3 - Payolution 4.0.3 - Ratepay 0.6.1 - Transfer 3.3.2 Documentation For(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)documentation see: Payment Module Guide . For detailed migration guides see: Payment Migration Guide . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/payment:"^4.0.0" CMS Content Widgets With CMS content widgets we are bringing more power to CMS pages and blocks. Now you can conveniently include products, product groups and products sets in placeholders of CMS pages and blocks. For each of those you can also define multiple templates. So for example a product widget can be applicable with different templates depending on your use cases in Yves, and when including the widget in the CMS placeholder you can define which template should be used for the widget. You can also extend this solution to provide your custom widgets, for example to include CMS blocks in placeholders of CMS pages, etc. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - CmsContentWidget 1.0.0 - CmsContentWidgetProductConnector 1.0.0 - CmsContentWidgetProductGroupConnector 1.0.0 - CmsContentWidgetProductSetConnector 1.0.0 - Cms 6.1.0 - CmsBlock 1.1.0 - CmsBlockCollector 1.1.0 - CmsBlockGui 1.1.0 - CmsCollector 1.2.0 - CmsGui 4.1.0 - ProductSet 1.1.0 n/a Documentation For(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)documentation see: CMS WidgetModule Guide .

Hence before using the values to create product variants those values have to be predefined. With this adjustment we added validation check to make sure that super attributes always use predefined values. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductManagement 0.7.1 Customer Address Country Options We've reduced the selectable options of countries for customer addresses in Zed UI to match with store configuration. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Customer 6.0.3 Configuration for CMS Placeholders To make placeholder management clear and easy the configuration for CMS placeholders is now moved to module configuration. This way the config for Business and Communication layers will be the same. Additionally, we now also support dots in placeholder names by default. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Cms 6.0.3 - CmsBlockGui 1.0.2 - CmsGui 4.0.1 Subscribe to Newsletter Without Customer Account Previously addingignoreableTransationsto NewRelic required overwriting theNewRelicFactoryto pass in an array with ignorable transaction route names. This can now be done in an easier manner by extending theNewRelicConfigon project side and returning an array with ignorable transaction route names fromNewRelicConfig:: getIgnorableTransactionRouteNames(). To achieve that, newsletter/subscription and other sub-requests are only visible as a master request in NewRelic. You will need to remove your NewRelic module in project and use Spryker'sNewRelicRequestTransactionServiceProviderasServiceProviderinstead of the formerNewRelicServiceProvider. TheNewRelicRequestTransactionServiceProviderfrom core takes care that only master requests are sent to NewRelic. In addition to that, the Newsletter module had a bug when a customer tried to unsubscribe from a newsletter given that this customer had subscribed before creating the account. The bug is now fixed by an additional lookup for subscription by email. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - NewRelic 3.1.0 - Newsletter 4.1.3 Enabled Open Range Queries for Filters Previously open ended range queries for integer and price facet filters were not possible. For example, when the user tried to apply an open ended range filter then both minimum and maximum was set to the same values which provided empty result at the end. With this release we enable open ended range queries. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Search 6.3.0 n/a Stock Management Previously theProductManagementmodule didn't show all stock types in View and Edit in Zed admin UI, only the initially imported ones for the given product were listed. This release provides an ability to set view and manage stock for all existing stock types. In addition to that previously it was not possible to manageNever out of stockflag for products via the Availability UI. This issues is also fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - AvailabilityGui 2.0.2 - Stock 4.0.3 Interface for Subscription Handler We had a strong coupling to one of the business model classes without an interface. To allow you to extend the logic we now introduced an interface in between. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Newsletter 4.1.4 Discount Filter We have added new filter plugin extension point to Discount module. This allows to filter discountable items after discount collectors run. It is executed for each discount. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Discount 4.3.0 - ProductDiscountConnector 3.1.0 - ProductLabelDiscountConnector 1.1.0 n/a Beta: HTTP OPTIONS Pre-flight Request Support Some REST clients need an HTTP OPTIONS pre-flight request prior the actual request. This is now supported and configurable per resource. In addition, we have also added CORS headers. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Api 0.1.1 Bugfixes Allow Entering the Same State Twice in StateMachine Previously the StateMachine didn't allow to enter the same state twice. This was especially the case for when the StateMachine had a loop in it. If you would process StateMachine item till the loop point, then attempt to return to previous state, the transition would fail with an exception. This issue is fixed now. We've modified StateUpdater logic to compare last history item state with destination state. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - StateMachine 2.0.2 Missing Transfer Property inProductOptionCartConnector We had a missing transfer property (ProductOptionTransfer::unitNetPrice) which was resulting to an exception. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductOptionCartConnector 4.1.1 Order Products Inside Category Zed provides a way to position abstract products on category catalog pages. Previously those positions were not being evaluated by the search, which was resulting in an arbitrary order of products in the catalog. With this release we introduce a new query expander that provides the missing behaviour. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Search 6.1.0 n/a MySQL Error When Managing Navigation Items There was an issue with managing navigation nodes, for example when typing category name to trigger autosuggestion, the autosuggestion was not working and an MySQL error was occurring. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - NavigationGui 1.0.2 Legacy Config Key Check Previously it was not possible to change theErrorRendererfromWebExceptionErrorRendererto theWebHtmlErrorRendererdue to a bug in theErrorHandlerFactory. TheErrorRenderercan now be changed with theErrorHandlerConstants::ERROR_RENDERERconfig option. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ErrorHandler 2.1.1 Constraints forAddressFormFields Previously, due to missing validation in theAddressFormin Zed customer address management, when user would enter a string longer than the character limit of the field an exception was thrown. We added validation messages to allAddressFormfields. This will now ensure that the length of the fields sent to the database will not be longer than the one configured. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Customer 6.0.2 CMS Block Template Path We had a bug in the CMS Block template path, because of which only templates from an obsolete folder (Cms) were visible in Zed admin backend. Because of this Zed user was able to use only imported templates. This issue is fixed, now you can also see newly added templates in the list. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsBlockGui 1.0.1 Removeing Previous Glossary Records CmsBlock template change action had a bug, which did not allow to remove previous glossary records and change template. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsBlock 1.0.2 Duplicate CMS Page Entries in Touch Table After full setup the touch table was containing same item twice for CMS pages. Our touch logic was inserting two events into touch table to delete and update, even if you only ‘edit’ an item. However this was necessary because the key in Redis would be different. For this reason we made sure that the old Redis entries with old keys were deleted, and new ones were inserted. To fix this we disabled key change touch for CMS pages. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Cms 6.0.2 Drop Timestamps We had bug in dropping timestamps from storage. Previously it was not possible to delete timestamps. After "Drop Timestamps" action the "Number of entries" count was the same as before the action. This issue is fixed now, we now use the storage key for deleting the timestamps instead of index. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Collector 5.1.4 - CollectorStorageConnector 1.0.1 Category Key Constraint When adding or updating a category with an already usedcategory_keythere was an exception thrown. This is now fixed and there will be a validation message displayed instead. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Category 3.2.2 Thousand Separator for Discount Value The Discount module had an issue with a discount amount storage. It was not able to recognise a thousand separator and was reducing the value by 100 on each save action. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Discount 4.2.2 Incorrect Stock Hydration There was an issue whenProductFacadewas trying to save concrete products with fully hydrated transfer with stock data. This release will fix the wrong stock hydration inProductTransfer. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductManagement 0.7.3 - Stock 4.0.4</body>
