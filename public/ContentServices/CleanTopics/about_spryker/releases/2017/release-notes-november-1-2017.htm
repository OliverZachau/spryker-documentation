    <body>This month we released some important security updates. Check them out here . Features Multi-currency for Shipments We are currently working on full enablement of multi-store and multi-currency concepts. In consequent releases we will be step-by-step enabling every relevant functionality with multi-store and -currency. This release focuses on enabling multi-currency for shipments. It allows you to manage multi-currency prices for shipment methods. We have extracted the shipment method price data to a separate table now (spy_shipment_method_price) and thedefault_pricefield is now deprecated inspy_shipment_methodtable. The shipment method prices in Yves are retrieved for the given store, price mode and selected currency. TheCheckoutAvailableShipmentMethodsPluginhas major impact in its result because of the multi-currency price structure. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - Shipment 6.0.0 - Kernel 3.13.0 - Money 2.3.0 - ShipmentDiscountConnector 1.1.1 Documentation For module documentation see: Shipment Module Guide .

This release includes main entities events, storage and search APIs, optimised Queue module, etc. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - Event 2.0.0 - Queue 1.0.0 - RabbitMq 1.0.0 - Availability 5.2.0 - Category 4.2.0 - Cms 6.3.0 - CmsBlock 1.4.0 - Console 3.2.0 - EventBehavior 0.1.0 - Glossary 3.2.0 - Kernel 3.12.0 - Navigation 2.1.0 - Price 4.3.0 - Product 5.3.0 - ProductCategory 4.4.0 - ProductGroup 1.1.0 - ProductImage 3.4.0 - ProductLabel 2.2.0 - ProductOption 5.4.0 - ProductRelation 1.1.0 - ProductSearch 5.2.0 - ProductSet 1.2.0 - PropelOrm 1.3.0 - Search 6.8.0 - Synchronization 0.1.0 - SynchronizationBehavior 0.1.0 - Transfer 3.5.0 - Url 3.2.0 - UtilSanitize 2.1.0 n/a Documentation For detailed migration guides see: RabbitMQ Module Migration Guide from Version 0. to 1. . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major and its dependencies: composer require spryker/rabbit-mq:"^1.0.0" spryker/event:"^2.0.0" spryker/event-behavior:"^0.1.0" spryker/queue:"^1.0.0" spryker/synchronization:"^0.1.0" spryker/synchronization-behavior:"^0.1.0" Improvements State Machine Sub-process Reuse Sub-processes in Spryker state machine allow to simplify workflows. Each sub-process can represent a part of your business logic. Sometimes within the business logic you might need to have same or similar sub-processes multiple times (e.g. transactional email, refund). With this release we allow to copy state machine sub-processes as many times as you need in a project workflow. This will allow you to reuse existing parts of a state machine schema. For more details see Modelling - State Machine . Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - StateMachine 2.1.0 n/a Aggregated Reservations for Availability Updates Previously we had an issue when reading the number of reserved items to calculate the product availability in Oms. Previously non-aggregated function was being used to read the reservation, which had an impact on performance. To improve this, now there is a new method in Oms module which only returns the aggregated numbers instead of running the whole calculation. The Availability module uses those aggregated numbers for product availability calculation. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Oms 7.2.0 - Availability 5.2.1 Dedicated Log Configuration Plugins Previously there was only one Log configuration which was used by Yves and Zed. It is now possible to use dedicated Log configuration plugins for each application. Handlers and Processors can now be different for the applications. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Log 3.2.0 - Queue 1.0.1 Decoupling JavaScript Dependency in CMS With this release we have removedCmsandCmsBlockGuiJavaScript hidden dependencies toCmsContentWidget. If you are usingCmsContentWidgetwithCmsand/orCmsBlockGui, and you want to update at least one of them, please updateCmsContentWidgetto version 1.1.1 or higher in order to avoid inconsistencies and issues in Zed Administrative Interface. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Cms 6.3.1 - CmsBlockGui 1.1.4 - CmsContentWidget 1.1.1 Bugfixes Missing Twig Variable on Zed Sales Detail View Previously there was a twig error in Zed order details page when displaying order items without grouping them. This was happening whenProductBundleOrderHydratePluginwas not enabled in the order hydration plugin stack. The issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Sales 8.0.4 Include Services in Dependency Violation Finder Previously dependency violation finder ignored Service files during dependency check. This issue is fixed now, service files are also checked for violation finding and their missing dependency are be highlighted. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Development 3.3.3 - FileSystem 1.0.2 - Flysystem 1.0.1 - FlysystemAws3v3FileSystem 1.0.1 - FlysystemFtpFileSystem 1.0.1 - FlysystemLocalFileSystem 1.0.1 - UtilDataReader 1.2.1 - UtilDateTime 1.0.2 - UtilEncoding 2.0.3 - UtilNetwork 1.1.1 - UtilSanitize 2.1.1 - UtilText 1.2.1 Multi-currency Support for Promotional Products Since the Multi-currency for Discounts was released, we had in issue with promotional products in discounts. The price was moved from product to quoteTransfer but promotional products still read from the old PRICE_MODE. So when trying to read the price, there was no price found. This issue is fixed now, it's now price agnostic. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - DiscountPromotion 1.0.3 Propel SQL Insert Command Fail PreviouslyInsertSqlConsoleused wrong path configuration. Executing this command was throwing an exception as it was not possible to load any configuration. We have now updated it, to use the one all other commands use. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Propel 3.2.2 Calculation BC Fix Our recent Calculation 4.2.0 release introduced a BC breaking issue in Calculation. TheDiscountAmountAggregatorwas calling$calculatedDiscountTransfer-&gt;getUnitAmount()yet the unit amount was introduced in a successive release. This issue is fixed now to make sure the Calculation does not depend on the Discount major.
