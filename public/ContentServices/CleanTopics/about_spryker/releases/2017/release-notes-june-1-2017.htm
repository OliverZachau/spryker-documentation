    <body>Improvements Session Service Provider Enhancement Previously the Yves and ZedSessionServiceProvidercontained a switch statement to determine whichSessionHandlershould be used. The switch is a violation of the open-close principle and therefore we refactored the currentSessionServiceProviderfor both applications. Now theSessionServiceProvideris able to get the options for$application['session.storage.options']and the handler for$application['session.storage.handler']from a newSessionStorageclass which is accessible via the factory. In addition, options are now properly retrieved from theSessionConfigclasses. Now you can add your ownSessionHandlerInterfaceseasier and in a more clean way. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Session 3.2.0 - Testify 3.2.4 Autoload Entry for BC The autoload entry for deprecated Testify\Module\Environment Codeception Helper was missing. We have now added it again to thecomposer.jsonfile. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Testify 3.2.5 Combining Product Images With these changes we introduce a common way to combine images related to a product. TheImageSetis the key subject of image inheritance. We take anImageSetfrom the next layer if on the current it does not exist. The nested logic is as follows: Abstract Default &gt; Abstract Localized &gt; Concrete Default &gt; Concrete Localized. To get all benefits of this fix you should arrange your collectors to use facade methods instead of raw-queries in your product collectors:ProductImageFacade::getCombinedAbstractImageSetsfor abstract product collector (ProductAbstractCollector) andProductImageFacade::getCombinedConcreteImageSetsfor concrete product collector (ProductConcreteCollector). This release is backward compatible, so if you have your own image collector functionality, you can keep it. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - ProductImage 3.2.0 - ProductManagement 0.5.0 n/a GetConfig for DependencyProvider Previously it was not possible to get the config of the module inside of theDependencyProvider. You can now usegetConfig()in yourDependencyProviderto get the bundle Config class. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Kernel 3.3.0 n/a Moving Glob to Finder For performance reasons we have movedglob()fromZedNavigationConfigtoZedNavigationSchemaFinder. This will avoid havingglob()called on every request. We have also enabled Zed path cache for Twig by default. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Twig 3.1.3 - ZedNavigation 1.0.6 Bugfixes Category Touch Logic Touch handling for categories didn’t cover certain use-cases when categories were moved around in the category tree. We had issues when adding/updating/deleting category node parents. Parent category nodes were not being touched, so they were not being updated about the changes in their children nodes. Old parent category nodes were not being touched, so they were not being notified about their children nodes. Products assigned to categories that are under a modified category sub-tree were also not being touched. We have now extended the touch handling to touch the entire tree branch from the root to the leaf for a modified category. Former parent nodes will also get touched along with related products in these tree branches. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Category 3.2.0 - ProductCategory 4.2.0 -n/a On Demand Formater for Querying Voucher Discounts We had an issue with multiple vouchers coming from the same pool. Propel’sObjectFormatterwas overwriting the virtual columns inDiscountQueryContainer::queryDiscountsBySpecifiedVouchers()results. This issue is fixed now. We addedOnDemandFormatterPropel formatter for discount voucher query in order to properly hydrate voucher discounts when codes were coming from same pool. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Discount 4.0.2 Incorrect Prices for Currencies with No Minor Units There was an error because of conversion from int to dec and dec to int. The field type money made no proper use of divisor and scale attributes to handle currencies with and without minor units properly. When price value was edited with a currency without minor units (e.g. Yen) then the conversion was wrong (e.g. 300 YEN was converted to 30000 YEN). This issue is resolved now. Affected(Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Currency 2.1.0 - ProductManagement 0.6.0 - ProductManagement 0.6.1</body>
