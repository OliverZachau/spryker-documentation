    <body>Features Multiple Wishlists This release introduces core functionality to support multiple wishlist handling in Yves. It is now possible to create multiple wishlists in customer account and select which wishlist to add a product to. In the customer account’s wishlist section, users can manage existing wishlists by renaming or removing. It is also possible to see how many products are in each wishlist. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Cart 3.1.0 - Wishlist 4.1.0 - Availability 5.0.1 - ProductBundle 2.0.2 Documentation For(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)documentation see: Wishlist. Generated Directory Removal Spryker generates certain files that are stored in configured folders (e.g. transfer-object files). With this release, we introduced a new strategy for removing cache files. Instead of removing the folders that contain the generated files, the respective commands now purge all generated contents from the folders without deleting the folders. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch - Setup 4.0.0 - Cache 3.1.0 - Transfer 3.2.0 n/a Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch:composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new Setup major and its dependencies:composer require spryker/setup:"^4.0.0" Beta: Data Feeds A set of DataFeed(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s that provide the functionality to query data and related information for export or processing. We will be using query containers to query abstract product, category, price and availability data. Query Containers, return query objects. You can use pagination, limits, add columns, query one or all when dealing with returned content. The DataFeed(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s are as follows: AvailabilityDataFeed , provides an API to get a product availability information. Available filters are locale id, updated dates. CategoryDataFeed(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module), provides an API to get information about categories. Available filters are locale id, updated dates. PriceDataFeed(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module), provides an API to get information about product prices. ProductAbstractDataFeed(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module), provides an API to get information about abstract products. Available filters are locale id, updated dates. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - AvailabilityDataFeed 0.1.0 - CategoryDataFeed 0.1.0 - PriceDataFeed 0.1.0 - ProductAbstractDataFeed 0.1.0 - AvailabilityDataFeed 0.1.1 - CategoryDataFeed 0.1.1 - PriceDataFeed 0.1.1 For Data Feed Documentation see: Improvements Twig Cache Warmup Previously the command twig:cache:warmup was used to open paths to find templates to be used in the cache file. Current paths are stricter and use the current active theme name to find templates. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Twig 3.1.1 Zed Navigation Fix Previously it was not possible to override navigation definitions from the core. It is now possible to have your own navigation schema. If you override the core definitions in the project schema your definitions will be used instead of the ones from the core. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ZedNavigation 1.0.2 Bugfixes Tax Calculation without Shipment Information Previously we had a problem for tax calculation without shipment information. If you would go to checkout without filling in address information and then go back to the shop, add to cart action for any product it would through an exception. The reason was the missing country reference which was failing to select the correct tax rate. This issue is fixed and the country ISO code now falls backs to the default value when no address is set. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Shipment 4.0.1 - TaxProductConnector 4.0.1 Yaml Batch Iterator The YamlBatchIterator didn’t get migrated in the recent dependency cleanup. With this release, we added it back to the correct(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module). Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - UtilDataReader 1.1.0 n/a Attribute Key Validation Constraints Previously it was possible to create product attribute keys with any kind of letters and symbols. Now, when creating product attributes with forms, they will be validated to have only lower case letters, digits, numbers, underscores (“_”), hyphens (“-“) and colons (“:”). Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductManagement 0.3.1 - ProductSearch 5.0.2 Collector Batch Fix with Big Data Sets When exporting big data sets to Redis some data was getting lost. This was happening because batching worked with non-ordered data and random results were being returned. This issue is resolved. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - UtilDataReader 1.2.0 - Collector 5.1.2 Displaying Duplicate Products in PIM There was an issue with displaying newly created product(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s twice in the product management UI in Zed. This issue was due to a wrong product query. The issue is fixed to make sure that each(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)product is listed only once. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductManagement 0.3.2 Identical Additional Category Parent When a category was saved with a same “additional parent” as its “parent”, the process did not finish due to an unique URL error. Now, additional parents that are the same as the parent will be ignored. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Category 3.1.1 Item Count in Cart with(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)Product We had an issue with item count plugin for the cart when a(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)product was added to the cart with different options. This issue is fixed now to make sure that each(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)item with its given option(s) is calculated correctly into the item count. The item count plugin now returns product(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)count per group key instead of SKU. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductBundle 2.0.1 Touch Fix for Deactivated Products There was an issue with inactive/active products in Elasticsearch. Once an active product was deactivated, it was not removed from the search. This issue is fixed and now touch handles the deactivation correctly and removes products from Elasticsearch when inactive. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Product 5.1.1 Zed Breadcrumbs and Navigation Fix There was an issue with collapsible menu items in the navigation. When a sub-menu item was selected and the user would try to navigate to the parent item through breadcrumbs, an exception was shown. With this fix we made sure that the broken URI is removed from the breadcrumbs and if a parent item is not accessible, the user stays on the same page. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Gui 3.1.1 - ZedNavigation 1.0.3 Handling Empty Strings in Glossary Keys Previously we had an issue when handling empty strings. Due to a known summernote issue Zed would send pre-generated html to Yves (&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;). Now the empty strings are handled and stored correctly and in our demoshop, we display the glossary key when it holds an empty string. Knowing the glossary key helps to discover what the missing content and translations are. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsGui 2.0.2 - Glossary 3.0.2 Newly Added Customer Address in Checkout Previously we had an issue in checkout with an addresses that were newly added to a customer account. When the new address was added to a customer account, in checkout the address would not show unless it was edited. This issue is fixed now by implementing a new client method to read the customer data from Zed. Zed response for customer data now also populates shipping and billing addresses. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a - Customer 4.1.0 n/a Default Currency for the Price Form Field Previously the ProductManagement and Shipment(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s used fixed currency in the price form field (EUR, default value of the MoneyType class of Symfony). Now product and shipment create/edit pages use the currency configured for the store. This is easily identified by the currency symbol for the price field. Affected(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)s Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductManagement 0.3.3 - Shipment 4.0.2</body>
