    <body>Features Order Details Improvement We have improved Zed usability for order management. Now in the order view you can have a convenient summary of products from the given order, including images and name of products. Product options related to the given product are visually differentiated making it easier to navigate through this view. Prices of products and options now display both the value before and after discount for better overview. We have also extended our current solution to include payment information on the order view. Depending on the payment provider the displayed information in this section will vary. To enable these changes: Add the following plugin toPyz\Yves\Checkout\CheckoutDependencyProvider: new ItemMetadataSaverPlugin(), Add the following plugins toPyz\Zed\Sales\SalesDependencyProvider: new ProductIdHydratorPlugin(),
new ProductOptionSortHydratePlugin(), // after ProductOptionOrderHydratePlugin

Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsGui 4.2.3 Initial Grand Total Calculator The discount module provides a plugin to set up a discount condition to grand total. However previously the Calculation module did not provide information about grand totals to make this kind of discount applicable. We have now extended the Calculation stack to provide all required information by discounts.

Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Discount 4.4.3 Restore Password Link Generation With this release we are consolidating the business logic of restore password links in the Customer module configuration. This allows to use the same restore logic both from Yves when customer requests a password, as well as from Zed admin backend to send a password token. By default we are pointing to‹yves_host›;/password/restoreto restore user passwords. If you have a custom URL to restore passwords, please extend and updateSpryker\Zed\Customer\CustomerConfig::getCustomerPasswordRestoreTokenUrl()method with a proper Yves URL.

Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Sales 7.1.3 Invalidate Discount Rule if Customer Primary Key Is Not Set Previously guest checkout was throwing an exception with an active cart rule with customer-group in conditions.
