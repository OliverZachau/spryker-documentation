    <body>Announcements PHP 7.2 is There Soon / EOL for PHP5.6 With the release of PHP 7.2 we want our Spryker code to stay cutting edge and using the best features available. Soon we want to start leveraging the new typehinting features the language provides and for that we need to stop supporting legacy version 5.*. With theend of Octoberwe stop supporting PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0. Please make sure your infrastructure is running on 7.1+ before that. Read gophp71.org for details on why 7.1+ is the next minimum version. Features Shipment Discount Current Spryker discounts (vouchers and cart rules) are calculated with fixed value or percentage reduction and those are applied to value of product(s). One of yet another very common discount concepts is free shipping or discounts that are applied on shipping costs. You might want to offer free shipment for various reasons. One of the most common ones is to motivate customers to increase the basket volume by offering free shipping for example for orders over 50€. With this feature our current discount engine now makes it possible to define discounts that are applied not only to products, but also to shipping expenses. For this reason three shipment discount types have been implemented: Carrier – a discount by a specific carrier (DHL, UPS etc) Method – a discount by a shipment method (To pick-up point, Door to Door etc) Price – a discount to a delivery price You can now create discount calculation rules like the one in the example below. The example below will ensure that if the selected shipment carrier is the Spryker Dummy Shipment, selected shipment method is the Express and the price of this Express shipment method is greater than or equal to 5, then the discount is applied. If for example you remove the middle rule ("shipment-method equal Express (Spryker Dummy Shipment)", then the discount will be applied for all shipment methods from Spryker Dummy Shipment shipment carrier if the price of the shipment method is greater than or equal to 5. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - ShipmentDiscountConnector 1.0.0 - Shipment 5.1.0 n/a Documentation For module documentation see: Shipment Module Guide . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/shipment-discount-connector:"^1.0.0" Improvements Create Injection Points for Project Logic for Twig Templates Before it was not possible to extend Spryker GUI tables and replace Twig template paths. With this release we are introducing configuration points through an extension of the abstract class to allow extensions. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Gui 3.7.1 Optional Category Template InCategorymodule an assigned template is not required (to make the migration easier), however inCmsBlockCategoryConnectorthis field was required. With this release now a category template is not required in both modules. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsBlockCategoryConnector 2.0.1 Shipment Delivery Time One of the Shipment models andShipmentMethodTransferhad the wrong PHPDoc information for delivery time. This issue is fixed now. Before, when expecting a string, you would get string or integer. To avoid confusion we have changed return type ofgetDeliveryTimeto the proper one (int|null). Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Shipment 5.0.2 Reset Password We had templates for changing a customer password, but this did not support passing a recovery token. With this release we deliver the complete functionality of password reset, including the request for it and update. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Customer 6.2.0 n/a NULL Password in Config for Storage After predis/predis library changed the approach of handling connection, params had an issue with supporting its new versions (&gt;=1.1.0). Now Spryker config handling is adjusted to Predis library. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Collector 5.1.6 - Storage 3.1.1 Missing Breadcrumbs In some pages of Zed the breadcrumb navigation was missing. We added all missing navigation entries into the navigation.xml files to fix all breadcrumbs. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Acl 3.0.1 - AvailabilityGui 2.0.3 - Category 4.0.1 - Cms 6.1.2 - CmsBlock 1.2.2 - CmsBlockGui 1.1.1 - CmsGui 4.2.1 - Customer 6.2.1 - CustomerGroup 2.1.2 - Development 3.1.4 - Glossary 3.1.5 - Gui 3.7.2 - Oms 7.0.2 - ProductManagement 0.7.6 - ProductOption 5.2.1 - ProductRelation 1.0.6 - ProductSearch 5.1.1 - Sales 7.1.1 - Search 6.4.2 - Shipment 5.0.3 - StateMachine 2.0.3 - Tax 5.1.1 - Testify 3.2.7 - User 3.0.2 - ZedNavigation 1.1.1 - ZedRequest 3.1.3 Elasticsearch Client Config We've added new environment config parameters to be able to customize the Elasticsearch connection configuration with Elastica Client. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Application 3.3.0 - Collector 5.2.0 - Heartbeat 3.1.0 - Search 6.5.0 n/a Architecture Sniffer Previously we only had a Zed backend page displaying architecture violations. A backend page listing all the sniffer rules for each application namespace has been added now including a short explanation. We now offer a CLI command as convenience wrapper to quickly check either modules or complete paths. We also introduced multiple priorities and use 2 by default for now. 3 stays an experimental. Please note that the sniff commands now are as follows: console code:sniff:style(the alias forcode:sniffis still present for BC) console code:sniff:architecture Tip: You can useconsole c:s:sandconsole c:s:aas shortcuts. For guidelines and documentation see: Code Architecture Guide . Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Development 3.2.0 n/a Increment Counter for Unlimited Vouchers Previously the number of uses was not increased for an unlimited voucher (not limit on a number of uses). It was inconvenient with voucher of a limited use. Now the counter increases do not depend on the type of a voucher. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Discount 4.4.1 Change Path to last_yves_request Log Previously there was no possibility to define a path for the yves_requests and they were stored under the logs directory. Those yves_reqeust files are not log files. The path for them is now configurable. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ZedRequest 3.1.4 Allow Check for Breadcrumbs in Communication Previously we usedRequest::createFromGlobals()in the ZedNavigationServiceProvider. We are now using the request object from the application instead. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Gui 3.8.0 - ZedNavigation 1.2.0 - Testify 3.2.9 Exclusive Custom Search and Storage Client Configuration With this release we enable setting exclusive search (Elastica) client and storage (Predis) client configuration. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Application 3.4.0 - Collector 5.3.0 - Heartbeat 3.2.0 - Search 6.6.0 - Storage 3.2.0 n/a Update to Allowsymfony/http-kernelV2 or V3 With this update we now allow symfony/http-kernel v2 or v3. In addition to this, we have also removed unneeded symfony/http-foundation dependency. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Symfony 3.1.0 n/a Bugfixes Unmapped Sort on Empty Category Previously an empty category (category that does not have products assigned to it) was throwing an Elastic exception. This was due to missing sort-s. This issue is fixed now by ignoring sort-s which are not mapped to the existing data in your Elastic. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Search 6.4.1 Drop Timestamped Storage Keys Zed / Maintenance / Storage contained a link to drop time stamped storage keys. This was not working as expected due to a bug in a passed parameter. With this fix, now it's possible to delete time stamp storage keys successfully. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CollectorStorageConnector 1.0.2 Dependencies Fixes Some third party modules have been locked down on bugfix level, which was making it difficult for projects to get small improvements. We want to be more allowing on core level by default for the vendor libraries that follow semantic versioning. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Zend 2.1.0 - Graphviz 2.0.1 - Money 2.0.2 - Monolog 2.0.3 currentLocalein Stores.php Previously thecurrentLocalewas only set for Zed. This is now set also for Yves. A call toStore::getInstance()-&gt;getCurrentLocale()will not throw an exception in Yves anymore. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Kernel 3.5.1 Composer Dependency toKernelforCmsGui Composer constraint from CmsGui to Kernel module was wrong. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsGui 4.2.2 Count Statements The Cms and Price modules were wrongly not throwing an exception for an empty collection when looking for CMS pages. This has now been resolved. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Cms 6.1.3 - Price 4.2.1 Guzzle Option'strict' =&gt; true We have added"strict" =&gt; truefor HTTP client calls to ZED, so that when redirect from HTTPs to HTTP is made, it does not drop the payload. See Guzzle documentation for allow_redirects .
