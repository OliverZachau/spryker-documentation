    <body>Features Discount Promotion Products For marketing reasons you, the shop owner, might sometimes give away free or discounted products. This can happen depending on the cart content or via a redeemed voucher code. With this release we are introducing discount promotions fully integrated in out discount engine. Now you can easily give away free perks for example when the cart value reaches to a certain threshold. Or for example when the customer buys certain product you can give away for free or with a reduced price a complimentary product. Some of the most common use cases for this feature are "buy one, get one for free", "buy product X, get product Y for free", "buy 10 of product X and get 1 of product X for free". All this is now possible with our discount promotions.

Reviews are a powerful marketing tool for your online store. There are various reasons why you might want to have this feature. Customer created content generates considerable amount of sales uplift by influencing your buyers decision making. A positive feedback from another buyer builds trust and increases the chances for the sale. In addition to that, product reviews can also positively affect your site’s organic search ranking in search engines, as this content increases the amount of overall unique content. The product review feature allows to submit product reviews and ratings in the shop application. We also ship this feature with a dedicated Zed admin user interface which allows the store manager to review submitted content, approve, reject, or delete reviews. The approved reviews, ratings, and assembled data can be displayed on demand in your shop for the products as well as those can be used for catalog filtering and/or sorting. With this feature we have also introduced an improvement to the search engine. Now the search is capable of storing and reading data divided in different types and indexes. Besides, the data tables are now capable of using additional data in presentation than defined in their headers.

This check can be used, for example, to find out if a maintenance page needs to be shown during deployment or not. Scripts can check for the return code 0 (all good) vs. 2 (migration needed). The command is auto-added toConsoleDependencyProviderwhen pulling this new minor. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Propel 3.2.0 n/a Config Profiler We have added a new WebProfiler Panel which shows all used Spryker configurations. To enable the ConfigProfiler you need to add it to your ConsoleDependencyProvider and enable it in your required environments by setting$config[ConfigConstants::ENABLE_WEB_PROFILER]to true. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Config 3.1.0 - Twig 3.2.2 Improvements Product Availability Retrieval Enhancement This release adds a new method to Availability Client which returns the product availability or null when it does not exist in Storage. The "getter" method of Availability Client now throws custom exception instead of generic one. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Availability 5.1.0 n/a Touch Aware Data Importers to Touch Inactive Previously it was only possible to add touch items active during the DataImport. With this change it is now possible to also touch inactive and deleted. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - DataImport 1.2.0 Validator Updates for Transfers We have adjusted theTransferValidatorto take the new simple array definitions into account. This also unifies normal array type to "array", "[]" issues a warning. Please runconsole transfer:validatein their CI to assert if only valid transfer definitions are added. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsBlockCategoryConnector 2.0.4 - CmsBlockProductConnector 1.0.3 - ProductOptionCartConnector 4.1.2 - Ratepay 0.6.3 - Transfer 3.3.5 Navigation Redis Entry Optimization The Redis entry for Main Navigation contained unneeded data for all navigation nodes, causing a big Redis entry. In a production environment, this Redis entry would take more time to fetch especially in a distributed setup as the latency would be even higher. This improvement cleans up the Navigation entry in Redis from all the unneeded data and improves the performance for loading the navigation. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - NavigationCollector 1.0.2 Kernel Class Resolver Performance Previously each call tocanResolve()was building a possible class name and checking if that class exists. With this improvement we added a cache that stores the already resolved class names to make sure that the entire resolving roundtrip is not done over and over again. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Kernel 3.6.0 - Testify 3.3.0 n/a Missing Index for Stock Table Concrete product collector has been slow because of a missing index. A missing index has been added now to increase the performance. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Stock 4.0.6 Price Check Query Performance To improve price check query performance, we have removed the count to make query faster. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Price 4.2.2 Output Execution Time for Importers With this release we are introducing output time taken indata:importcommands. The time in milliseconds has been added toDataImporterReportTransfer. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - DataImport 1.1.0 n/a Mget Cache StorageClient implements internal cache mechanism for "get" method: all "get" requests will be combined in one initial "get" and a single "multiGet". Previously it was missing for direct "multiGet" call. Since this release "get" and "multiGet" use the same cache bag and mechanism. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Storage 3.3.0 n/a Bugfixes Allow Null in Setter for Array Properties Previously for a property with type array it was not possible to reset it withnullanymore. This update will restore this deprecated but formerly working behavior as part of a regression fix. Please migrate your code to use a true[]for resetting. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Transfer 3.3.6 Work with Missing Translations Previously the "translation key exists" check considered all translation keys regardless of the selected locale, but "translation retrieval" retrieved translations from current locale only. This was causing an error in case if the translation existed in the non-current locale. We have fixed this issue now. The translate methods now work on the selected locale's translation key set. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Glossary 3.1.8 Image Set Name Validation Previously when something wrong was entered in the image set key, the search collector was failing with an error. We have fixed this issue now. Image set name is validated before saving. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - ProductSetGui 1.1.1 Default Behavior for Propel Adjustments Command By default in projects, a command for Propel adjustments for PostgreSQL was running for project and all Spryker modules.
