    <body>Features Filter by Product Labels We've changed product label touch logic in order to be able to export label IDs for products when their label relations change. This will allow you to further search and filter by labels. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - ProductLabel 2.0.0 n/a n/a Documentation For module documentation see: Product Label Module Guide . For detailed migration guides see: Product Label Migration Guide . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/product-label:"^2.0.0" Data Importers With this release we are introducing a newDataImportmodule. This module is for handling data imports. The newDataImportallows not only inserts, but also updates. It is now possible to execute only one specific import. Every data importer has its own console command and can be configured from the console. The module uses theEventmodule in certain cases, for example to print debug output to the console or time information if the specific subscriber is added. With this new solution it is also now possible to execute specific lines of aDataImport. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - DataImport 1.0.0 - ErrorHandler 2.1.0 - Category 3.2.1 - CategoryExporter 3.0.1 - Glossary 3.1.3 - Stock 4.0.2 - Testify 3.2.6 Documentation For module documentation see: DataImport HowTos . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/data-import:"^1.0.0" New Products and Dynamic Labels We've added support for dynamic product labels. Labels now can be assigned to products based on custom business logic which can be implemented in form of plugins. We've also addedProductNewmodule that extends products with new from - to date properties. Based on these dates "NEW" label can be assigned dynamically to products. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch - ProductNew 1.0.0 - ProductLabel 2.1.0 - ProductLabelCollector 1.1.0 - ProductLabelGui 1.1.0 - Search 6.4.0 - ProductManagement 0.7.5 Documentation For module documentation and integration guides see: ProductNew Module Guide . Migration Guides To upgrade, follow the steps described below: Apply every minor and patch: composer update "spryker/*" Once that is done, upgrade to the new module major: composer require spryker/product-new:"^1.0.0" Category Template and CMS Block Position With this release we are introducing templating and CMS page block positioning for categories. With our out of the box solution, you can manage categories as catalog pages, as a mix of catalog with blocks included or as pure content pages. You can modify the provided templates, as well as you can extend our solution to include your custom templates. CMS block positioning can be used for placing a block in certain places in your template (like for example include banners in the top position, some SEO text in the bottom position, etc.). Out of the box, category pages have only 1 default position. For a more advanced template take a look at our demoshop. Here we showcase top, middle and bottom positions. You can extend our solution in a way that will help you better manage your content by changing its configuration.

You can now addServiceProvider-s which are needed for cron based commands. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Console 3.1.0 n/a CORS Headers With this release we make sure that CORS headers are now fully compliant with the standard. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Api 0.1.2 Storage Client Cache TheStorageClientremembers all GET calls to Redis that happen during one request. On any subsequent call it makes a single MGET to retrieve all the necessary data, plus one initial GET request to get the cache keys from Redis. Our former solution, where the request was identified by the URL including the GET parameters, was leading to a conceptual problem. Some URL parameters (e.g. the marketing parameters like mid=123) were spamming the cache. To solve this issue we added strategy options for storage cache. The options are: Incrementalfor using the same key and incrementing the cache inside it. This strategy has a limit for the number of keys for one cache. The default limit is 1000. If the number of keys is over limit, normal GET requests will be used for the uncached keys. Replacefor using the same key and replacing it with the new cache. Inactiveto deactivate the cache. We also added a method to manage cache strategies where every controller can specify its own strategy. The default value for all controllers is the replace strategy. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - Storage 3.1.0 n/a Bugfixes Filter Data Based on Activation Flags We had an issue with ES, where not active CMS pages were searchable. To fix this issue we added two new search expanders, to enable filtering of data based on activation flags.IsActiveInDateRangeQueryExpanderPluginis meant for filtering out active records within stored date range.IsActiveQueryExpanderPluginis used for filtering records with is-active flag. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a - CmsCollector 1.1.0 - Search 6.2.0 n/a Filter Behavior with Percentage Discount The filters for discounts are applied after discount calculation. Because of that we had an issue that the percentage portion for a discount was not correctly calculated. This issue is fixed now, filters are applied before the discount calculation. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Discount 4.3.1 Save Category With a recent fix we had introduced a bug: when trying to save existing category it was not allowing to save because of key duplication, it was thinking that the key is already taken. This regression is now resolved. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Category 3.2.4 Path for CodeSniffer Project Run When providing a custom path for project sniffing, that path wasn't normalized and always required a leading slash. This has been fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Development 3.1.3 Step Engine: Redirect to Correct Step if a Step is Skipped The step engine selects the current step that needs to be processed based on post conditions. We had an issue when post-conditions of previous steps were failing. If the requested step was not equal to the current step, it was recognising the correct step, but there was no correct redirect. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - StepEngine 3.0.1 Send an Email Only on Successful Registration Previously the Customer module was sending a registration email even on failed registration. Now this issue is fixed and the email will only be sent on successful registration. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - Customer 6.1.1 Duplicated Index in CMS Block One of CMS block related indices was duplicated and had the same name as a foreign key. Due to this some of systems were not able to process this migration. This issue is fixed now. Affected Modules Major Minor Patch n/a n/a - CmsBlock 1.2.1 Fix Twig Templates So Standard Symfony Twig Logic Can Be Applied Previously it was required to add an*(asterisk) into labels when form field was required. It's now added automatically when the form field'srequiredoption is set to true.

The core paths were overwriting project paths. This has been fixed now to overwrite core files with the ones from the project.
