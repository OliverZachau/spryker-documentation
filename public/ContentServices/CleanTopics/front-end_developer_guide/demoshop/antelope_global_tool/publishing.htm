    <body>Antelope Deprecation Notice: As of 04/2017 Antelope will be replaced by Oryx . You can still use Antelope however, no new development is planned for this component. To publish assets means to place them (or the build output files) in a place where they can be accessed and loaded by the browser. Assets can only be published to the@project/publicfolder. Contents: Application Folders @project/public/Yves @project/public/Zed These folders contain only application-related public files. Each file is directly accessible from the browser by using the/&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;path. Do not add any files here: they won’t be accessible. Due to strict nginx configuration, only the content that already exists is public. Asset Dedicated Folders @project/public/Yves/assets @project/public/Zed/assets These folders can contain any file that needs to be accessed and loaded by the browser. Contents can be addressed by using the/assets/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;path. Assets must be placed here. Yves Theme Folders To avoid conflicts and unexpected behaviour in the Yves UI, create a subfolder (@project/public/Yves/assets/&lt;theme&gt;) for each theme you have in your project, and place the related files there.</body>
