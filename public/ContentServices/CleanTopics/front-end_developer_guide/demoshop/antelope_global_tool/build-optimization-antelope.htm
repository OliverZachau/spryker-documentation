    <body>Antelope Deprecation Notice: As of 04/2017 Antelope will be replaced by Oryx . You can still use Antelope however, no new development is planned for this component. We useAntelopefor transpiling/building the assets and to optimize the resulting output. Read more about antelope configuration . The Assets Tree Antelope relies onwebpack, so we need to understand how the build process works. In a nutshell, the builder starts reading the assets, by searching for expressions such as: require(...)injavascript; url(...)orsrc(...)incss; @import '...'inscss; These expressions tellwebpackthat other assets are needed, and that they must be loaded. This way, crawling files one by one, the builder processes the whole assets tree. By using loaders , webpack knows how to behave depending on the type of the file. Entry Points Entry points are the files thatwebpackstarts to build first.
Automatic loading
Antelope can automatically find and load entry points. When you create one (usually ajsfile), follow this naming convention: &lt;application&gt;-[&lt;theme&gt;-]&lt;name&gt;.entry.js &lt;application&gt;(mandatory): tells Antelope which application to target; &lt;theme&gt;(mandatory, only for Yves): tells Antelope which theme to target; &lt;name&gt;(mandatory): entry point name; .entrysuffix: tells Antelope to load this file as an entry point. Examples: Yves:yves-demoshop-main.entry.jswhere yves is the target application, demoshop is the target theme and main is the entry point name; Zed:zed-editor.entry.jswhere zed is the target application and main is the entry point name. Spryker Core entry points for Zed bundles In Spryker Core, due to the high number of(Undefined variable: General.bundles/modules)(and, consequently, of entry points) we have a different naming convention:spryker-zed-&lt;(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)&gt;-&lt;name&gt;.entry.js. Manual loading You can manually specify which entry points Antelope must load, by adding them to thewebpackconfiguration file. In this case, feel free to use the naming convention that you prefer.</body>
