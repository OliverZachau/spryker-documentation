    <body>Antelope Deprecation Notice: As of 04/2017 Antelope will be replaced by Oryx . You can still use Antelope however, no new development is planned for this component. When using the termassets,
we refer to a set of resources used for building UI. These resources include; html, css (or less, sass, stylus, etc.) and js (or jsx, etc.) files, images, fonts and so on. Assets are files, a large collection of files; a solution to manage them it’s crucial. We point out 4 different steps to achieve this: Download and structure : get external dependencies and put assets into the corresponding folders; Development : write and connect your assets; Transpile/build and optimization : manipulate and optimize assets; Publishing : place built output into a public and accessible folder. Legend We use the following path aliases in the documentation: @project: your project root folder; @core: Spryker core folder, usually (but not necessary)@project/vendor/spryker.</body>
