    <body>Antelope Deprecation Notice: As of 04/2017 Antelope will be replaced by Oryx . You can still use Antelope however, no new development is planned for this component. Antelope is an npm global command line tool based upon webpack module bundler, designed to build the assets and publish them. Requirements: node.js version 5.0.0 or above; npm version 3.6.0 or above; the tool must be installed as globalnpmmodule: you may need admin privileges. Legend: We use path aliases to help you dive into antelope docs: @project: your project root folder; @core: Spryker core folder, usually (but not necessary)@project/vendor/spryker; @antelope: antelope global module folder, usually (on OSX - it changes depending on the OS)/user/local/lib/node_modules/antelope.</body>
