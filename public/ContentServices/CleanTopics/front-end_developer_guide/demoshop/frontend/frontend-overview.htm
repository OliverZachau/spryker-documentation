    <body>To learn how to build your assets in our Demoshop, read the Demoshop Guide . Asset Management A set of resources used to build the UI, that includeshtml,css(orless,sass,stylus, etc.) andjs(orjsx, etc.) files, images, fonts and so on. Assets are files, a large collection of files; a solution to manage them it’s crucial. We point out 4 different steps to achieve this: download and structure : get external dependencies and put assets into the corresponding folders; development : create your frontend; transpile/build and optimization: manipulate and optimize assets; public folder : place built output into a public and accessible folder. Legend We will use path aliases to help you dive into the assets docs: @project: your project root folder; @core: Spryker core folder, usually (but not necessary)@project/vendor/spryker.</body>
