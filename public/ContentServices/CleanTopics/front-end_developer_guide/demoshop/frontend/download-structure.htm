    <body>Here you will find out how to download external dependencies and where to place them, together with your own asset files. This page contains references to the following tools: Webpack , Oryx (Our frontend helper tool)and Oryx for Zed (Zed's frontend full automation tool). Make sure you are familiar with these tools before continuing. Yves Yves UI must be implemented on project level. Dependencies You can use the package manager that you prefer, but we strongly recommend to usenpmoryarn. Creating/extending Yves Yves come with themes: they are basically UI dresses. You can create a new theme by creating a folder under@project/assets/Yvesand placing your assets there. Change the@project/package.jsonmanifest file to manage all external dependencies. npm install --save jquery bootstrap font-awesome # add yves direct dependencies
npm install --save-dev sass-loader node-sass # add build dev dependencies Zed Zed UI can be extended on project level. Core Dependencies Each(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)that implements a UI may have external dependencies. They are declared in the corrisponding@core/&lt;(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)-name&gt;/assets/Zed/pakage.jsonmanifest file.Please do not change this file as it’s part of a core(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module). If you want to add a new dependency to Zed, read Download External Dependencies section. To download the(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)dependencies, you can use the package manager that you prefer, but we strongly recommend to usenpmoryarn. They will be eventually stored under the@core/&lt;(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)-name&gt;/assets/Zed/node_modulesfolder. Extending Zed Zed has one theme only. You can extend the Zed UI by creating@project/assets.zedand place your assets in there. Useoryx-for-zedto include and manage your code Gui(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)as default UI provider: Gui(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)manages all the dependencies needed in Zed. It provides the base structure for every(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)that implements a UI, and Zed Antelope configuration.Be sure you have it in your project, otherwise Zed UI will not be available. Download External Dependencies The best way to download all the external dependencies is by using./setup -i|-zed: cd /path/to/your/project-root
./setup -i Otherwise, usenpmoryarn: cd /path/to/your/project-root
npm install cd /path/to/gui/(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)npm install cd /path/to/another/(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)npm install</body>
