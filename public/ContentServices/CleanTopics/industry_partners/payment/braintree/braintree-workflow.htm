    <body>Both credit card and PayPal utilize the same request flow. It basically consists of the following requests: Pre-check: to check the user information in order to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization. Authorize: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is basically considered accepted when it is authorized. Revert: to cancel the authorization step which basically cancels the payment before capturing. Capture: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer. Refund: to refund the buyer when returning products.
