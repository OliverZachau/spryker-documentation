    <body>From the user's perspective, there is almost no difference between successful and unsuccessful order flow. The only exception is a redirect to the URL after the placeOrderAction (/checkout/place-order) is complete. Both urls can be configured as follows: $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES]; //url which is used in case if order was successfuly handled by Heidelpay $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES] . '/checkout/success'; //url which is used in case if order was unsuccessfully handled by Heidelpay $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_FAILED_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES] . '/heidelpay/payment-failed?error_code=%s'; Data flow containing information about the Heidelpay transaction error are marked red.
