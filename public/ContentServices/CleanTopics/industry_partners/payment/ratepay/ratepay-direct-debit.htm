    <body>(ELV) Workflow Scenarios Payment Flow Cancellation Flow Partial Cancellation Flow Refund Flow Integrating RatePAY Direct Debit Payment
In order to integrate direct debit payment, two simple steps are needed: set RatePAY Direct Debit payment configuration and call the facade functions. Set RatePAY Direct Debit Configuration The configuration to integrate Direct Debit payments using RatePAY is: PROFILE_ID: merchant’s login (required). SECURITY_CODE: merchant’s password (required). SHOP_ID: shop identifier (required). SYSTEM_ID: system identifier (required). CLIENT_VERSION: client system version. CLIENT_NAME: client name. RATEPAY_REQUEST_VERSION: request version. RATEPAY_REQUEST_XMLNS_URN: request XMLNS urn. MODE: the mode of the transaction, either test or live (required). API_TEST_URL: test mode API url. API_LIVE_URL: live mode API url. DEBIT_PAY_TYPES: debit pay types, can be DIRECT-DEBIT or BANK-TRANSFER. Perform Requests In order to perform the needed requests, you can easily use the implemented state machine commands and conditions. The RatePAY State Machine Commands and Conditions section gives a summary of them. You can also use the facade methods directly which, however, are invoked by the state machine.</body>
