]; $config[OmsConstants::ACTIVE_PROCESSES] = [ ... 'ComputopSofort',
]; Sofort Payment Flow: There is a radio button on "Payment" step. After submitting the order the customer will be redirected to the Computop (Paygate form implementation). The GET consists of 3 parameters: data (encrypted parameters, e.g. currency, amount, description); length (length of 'data' parameter); merchant id (assigned by Computop); Customer sets up all data just after the redirect to Computop. Init action: "Capture". There are no Order and Authorization calls provided for this payment method. By default, on success the customer will be redirected to "Success" step. The response containspayIdOn error, the customer will be redirected to "Payment" step with the error message by default. Response data is stored in the DB. Capture/Refund and Cancel actions are implemented in the admin panel (on manage order). On requests, Spryker will usepayIdparameter stored in the DB to identify a payment.
