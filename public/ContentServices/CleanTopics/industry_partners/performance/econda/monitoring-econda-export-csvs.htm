    <body>To implement Econda plugin you should be familiar with the concept of extending Spryker and plugins. Zed Output Folder We need to define the output folder where the generated CSV files will be saved. This is done by adding a line in your config. config [EcondaConstants::CSV_FOLDER_PATH] = APPLICATION_ROOT_DIR . '' ; The application must have Read / Write access to the folder because here we will generate CSV files and read them. Console To export the products and categories, we must register the Collectors that were created in the Console . Econda module has already everything in place and only thing you need to do is to addCollectorFileExportConsoletoPyz\Zed\Console\ConsoleDependencyProviderlike in the snippet bellow: use SprykerEco\Zed\Econda\Communication\Console\EcondaFileExportConsole; ... /** * @param \Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container $container * * @return \Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command[] */ public function getConsoleCommands(Container $container) { $commands = [ //rest of the function code new EcondaFileExportConsole(), //rest of the function code } Checking Your Setup If all the steps are followed correctly, you should be able to see theeconda:file:exportcommand in Econda section when you runvendor/bin/consolefrom the project's root folder. Runningvendor/bin/console econda:file:exportwill create several CSV files in the folder you have specified in$config[EcondaConstants::ECONDA_CSV_FOLDER_PATH].
